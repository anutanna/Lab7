                Hey there! I'm Anu, a web developer, creative thinker, and problem solver with a passion for bringing ideas to life.  
                I thrive on challenges, whether it's designing sleek, user-friendly web experiences or diving into full-stack development.
              </p>
              <p>
                My background in mechanical design, computer science, and finance has given me a unique perspective on problem-solving.  
                I love turning ideas into reality—whether it's coding an interactive UI, designing a financial model, or creating a mechanical prototype.
              </p>
              <p>
                But let’s talk about what makes me, me.  
                When I’m not coding, you’ll find me gardening (yes, I grow my own veggies!), cooking from scratch, and baking the fudgiest brownies you’ll ever taste.  
                I believe in learning something new every day, which is why I also practice judo—because staying disciplined and in control applies to both life and tech.
              </p>
              <p>
                Oh, and if you love good conversations, sitcoms, and motivation—we'll get along great.   
                Whether you need tech advice, career motivation, or just someone to bounce ideas off , I’m always happy to connect! 
              </p>
